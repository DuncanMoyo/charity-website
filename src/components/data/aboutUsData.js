      aboutHer: "Spending time at national parks can be an exciting adventure, but this wasn't the type of excitement she was hoping to experience.

We'll drive from Las Vegas through Mojave National Preserve and possibly do a short hike on our way down. Then spend all day on Monday at Joshua Tree.
