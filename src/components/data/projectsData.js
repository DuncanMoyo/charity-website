  paragraph1:
    "Alakhe has a firm belief in ploughing into the future generation of students. Each year thousands of children across the country are faced with the inevitable reality that they will not be able to return to school due to their inability to afford stationery and school uniform",
  paragraph2:
    "Although South African children who cannot afford to pay for their schooling are exempt from paying for their school fees, this still does not guarantee that they will be able to experience education in the same way as other students if their lack of resources disables them.",
  paragraph3:
    "Alakhe started this year with a back to school programme assisting learners in the communities of Cape Town to start their school year with a smile on their faces. ",
  paragraph4:
    "We look forward to the continued collaboration with these communities. ",
